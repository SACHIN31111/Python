A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union (A ∪ B) - Combines both sets
print(A | B)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection (A ∩ B) - Common elements
print(A & B)  # Output: {3, 4}

# Difference (A - B) - Elements in A but not in B
print(A - B)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference (A Δ B) - Elements in A or B but not both
print(A ^ B)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}
